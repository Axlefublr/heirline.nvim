## About

Heirline.nvim is a no-nonsense Neovim Statusline plugin designed around
recursive inheritance to be exceptionally **fast** and **versatile**.

Heirline **does not** provide any default statusline, in fact, heirline can be
thought of as a statusline API.

> **Why another statusline plugin?**

Heirline picks up from other popular customizable statusline plugins like
[galaxyline](https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/galaxyline.nvim) and
[feline](https://github.com/feline-nvim/feline.nvim) but removes all the
hard-coded bloat and offers you thousands times more freedom. But freedom has a
price: responsibility. I don't get to tell you what your statusline should do.
You're in charge! With Heirline, you have a framework to easily implement
whatever you can imagine, from simple to complex rules!

Heirline was deigned with these main features in mind:

- Active/inactive and buffer/filetype custom statuslines.
- Modularity: statusline components can be reutilised and will behave according to their position in the genealogical tree.
- Seamless surrounding and coloring of specific components.

Heirline is _not_ for everyone, heirline is for people who like tailoring their own tools (and also like lua):

- **No** default statusline is provided
- You **must** write your own statusline

But don't you worry! Along with the inheritance comes [THE FEATUREFUL COOKBOOK](cookbook.md) ðŸ“–
of a distant relative. Your dream ðŸª„ statusline is a
copypaste away!

## Installation

Use your favorite plugin manager

```lua
use "rebelot/heirline.nvim"
```

## Setup

No defaults, no options, no-nonsense. You choose.

```lua
local statusline = {...}
require'heirline'.setup(statusline)
```

Calling `setup` will load your statusline. To learn how to write a StatusLine, see the [docs](cookbook.md).
